This dual focus opens doors to wider adoption, increased liquidity, and potential partnerships that were previously out of reach for privacy-centric cryptocurrencies. Key Advantages in the New Landscape:

Salvium's innovative approach includes:

1.  Refundable Transactions: A feature allowing exchanges to comply with regulatory requirements without compromising the core privacy of the protocol.
2.  Selective Transparency: Users can provide full view keys to authorized entities, enabling compliance checks while maintaining privacy in general transactions.

These features not only ensure our compliance but also enhance our appeal to a broader range of users and institutions.
